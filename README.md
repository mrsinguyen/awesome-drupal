At its core it is a drag and drop content manager that lets you visually design a layout and place content within that layout.

* [Smart Trim](https://www.drupal.org/project/smart_trim) - Smart Trim implements a new field formatter for textfields (text, text_long, and text_with_summary, if you want to get technical) that improves upon the "Summary or Trimmed" formatter built into Drupal 7.

* [Commerce](https://www.drupal.org/project/commerce) - Drupal Commerce is used to build eCommerce websites and applications of all sizes.

In the context of search engine optimization, when people refer to meta tags they are usually referring to the meta description tag and the meta keywords tag that may help improve the rankings and display of a site in search engine results. In addition, the module provides support for meta tags (Open Graph Protocol from Facebook, Twitter Cards from Twitter) that allow control of how content appears when shared on social networks.
